Party Size Evolved Changelog
=======
# 1.2.1.0
* Nameless Isle
	* Added a workaround for party members 5-10 not teleporting to a position during the Arena of the One event.

# 1.2.0.0
* Nameless Isle
	* Fix for the romance dialog after the Arena of the One not including all Origin companions. All companions should now participate:  
[![Lady Vengeance Romance Dialog](https://i.imgur.com/j35tITSl.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/j35tITS.png)
	* Originally this dialog was only designed for 1 player and 3 companions. I had to edit the dialog to add in the other 3 potential companions, and add a bit of scripting to get those extra companions to move into place / be added to the dialog when it starts.

# 1.1.1.0
* Added some safety checks for preventing the original Reflection Dialog script from re-activating.

# 1.1.0.4
* Added some additional checks to prevent settings books from spawning when in a multiplayer lobby. If the book was already added, this flag is cleared when updating, so players who missed getting their settings book should get a new one now.

# 1.1.0.3
* Added a Party Management menu, allowing players to transfer characters to other users, which gets around the UI limitations in the original character transfer screen.
* Added Next Character / Previous Character skills, available from the settings menu, to allow controllers to switch to characters outside the normal 4 max.

# 1.0.0.1
* Initial Release
