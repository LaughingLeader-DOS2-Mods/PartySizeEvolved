Party Size Evolved Changelog
=======
# 1.1.1.0
* Added some safety checks for preventing the original Reflection Dialog script from re-activating.

# 1.1.0.4
* Added some additional checks to prevent settings books from spawning when in a multiplayer lobby. If the book was already added, this flag is cleared when updating, so players who missed getting their settings book should get a new one now.

# 1.1.0.3
* Added a Party Management menu, allowing players to transfer characters to other users, which gets around the UI limitations in the original character transfer screen.
* Added Next Character / Previous Character skills, available from the settings menu, to allow controllers to switch to characters outside the normal 4 max.

# 1.0.0.1
* Initial Release
